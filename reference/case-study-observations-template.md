# Case Study Observations Template

**Instructions:** Copy this file to `case-studies/<project-name>/<project>-port-observations.md`
before starting the port. Fill in each phase section as you complete it. Do not skip
phases — even if a phase was trivial, record that it was trivial and why.

> [Quote from `reference/python-to-rust-playbook.md`, Phase 1, with section reference]

### What actually happened
[Description of actual experience during assessment]

### Playbook assessment
- [ ] Helpful — guidance was accurate and useful
- [ ] Wrong — guidance was factually incorrect: [what should change]

- [ ] Missing — no guidance existed for this situation: [what to add]
- [ ] Too specific — guidance was flowmark-specific, not general: [how to generalize]

### Suggested playbook change
**File:** [e.g., `reference/python-to-rust-playbook.md` section "Phase 1"]
**Change:** [Specific text change or addition, or "None"]

### Time spent
[e.g., "15 minutes, all agent"]
